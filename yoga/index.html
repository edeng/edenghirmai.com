										<h2 class="major">'The Faster Things Go -- The More You Should Slow Down'</h2>
										<p>Yoga and TT provided me my first space where slowing down was encouraged. The only other time I can remember
											being encouraged to slow down is when my mom was teaching me how to drive. Everyone in TT has inspired
											me so much with their presence and calmness even when I know they carry such hectic schedules.</p>

										<h2 class="major">'The Most Important People in Your Life are the People in This Room'</h2>
										<p>It was such a powerful experience to know everyone in the room was so attentive (which did make my constant 		battle of trying to stay awake a little embarrassing). I could really feel how involved and interested 			everyone was in everyone's story. It was such a change from a world
											where you're used to being ignored 30% of the time because the person you're engaging with is on their phone.</p>

										<h2 class="major">'You are Responsible for the Energy You Bring Into this Room'</h2>
										<p>Almost every time I got home from teacher training I felt so good that it almost seemed a bit weird to me. Everyone's presence really fueled me to become a better person. Whether it was the fact that Micah puts her all into TT even though she literally just had a child, the fact that Juliana was traveling all over the place for work but still made time for TT, or just the overall positivity, acceptance and openness of everyone in the group.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Aha-sanas</h2>
									<p>There were a ton of aha-sanas during TT. It's amazing how much time I've put into yoga and TT and how it feels like it's only the beginning. Here are some of the main takeaways from my experience:</p>
									<section class="features">
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Feedback</h3>
											<p>I've always loved me some good feedback, but I really like how efficiently we go about receiving and giving feedback. I love the idea of 'taking what works and leaving the rest.' It's seems so simple, but that saying has really helped me not just in yoga, but in life being able to create a 'filter' when taking in information and feedback. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/img4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Compassion</h3>
											<p>The compassion from everyone I felt in TT definitely had the most significant impact on me. I think we are often surrounded by lack of emotion and feeling, and I loved how everyone was willing to become vulnerable and open in our (egg shaped) circles and was so encouraging. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/img8.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Humor</h3>
											<p>I love how everyone in TT was lighthearded and made sure we did not take everything so seriously. I can tend to be too serious of a person sometimes, and the constant jokes and smiles from everyone made it really easy to come to TT even after a long day of work. </p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/img7.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Confidence</h3>
											<p>I can struggle with being confident in presentations if I am not 100% positive about my proficiency in the material. Through TT I've learned how to become more confident and actually believe that I'm doing well when I am constantly told that I am doing well. </p>
